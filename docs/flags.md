# Flags

::: tip
Flags go after the subcommand: `yolobox run --flag cmd` or `yolobox claude --flag`, not `yolobox --flag run cmd`.
:::

## Runtime & image

| Flag | Description | Incompatible with |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `--runtime <name>` | Use `docker`, `podman`, or `container` | |
| `--image <name>` | Override the base image | |
| `--platform <value>` | Container platform, e.g. `linux/amd64`; persistent volumes are kept per architecture | Apple `container` |
| `--name <name>` | Assign a runtime container name | |
| `--packages <list>` | Comma-separated apt packages for a derived custom image | Apple `container` |
| `--customize-file <path>` | Dockerfile fragment for a derived custom image | Apple `container` |
| `--rebuild-image` | Force rebuild of the derived custom image | Apple `container` |
| `--ensure-latest` | Force-pull the configured base image before running, then rebuild any derived image on top | |

### `--ensure-latest` vs `--rebuild-image` vs `yolobox upgrade`

These target different layers:

- `--ensure-latest` — force-pulls the **configured base** image from its registry
  for this run (even if a copy already exists locally), then rebuilds the derived
  custom image on top if your project has customization. The base it pulls is
  whatever `--image` / `image` resolves to (default `ghcr.io/finbarr/yolobox:latest`):
  with the default tag this fetches the newest image; with a pinned tag it re-pulls
  that exact tag (a no-op unless it was re-pushed, so it never moves past the pin);
  with a fully custom `--image` it pulls that image rather than the yolobox one. It
  does not touch the yolobox binary.
- `--rebuild-image` — rebuilds only the **derived** custom image (packages /
  Dockerfile fragment). It does not refresh the base image, and has no effect
  without customization.
- `yolobox upgrade` — updates the yolobox **binary** and pulls the latest base
  image. This is the full update path; `--ensure-latest` is the per-run,
  image-only subset.

| `--cap-drop <cap>` | Drop Linux capabilities, repeatable | |
| `--runtime-arg <flag>` | Pass raw runtime flags directly to Docker or Podman | |

## SSH agent on macOS

On macOS, `--ssh-agent` depends on the VM forwarding the agent:

- Docker Desktop forwards it automatically
- Colima needs `forwardAgent: true` in `~/.colima/default/colima.yaml`, then a restart
- Podman machine does not expose the host SSH agent inside its VM. yolobox stops
  with an actionable error instead of mounting a socket path from an unrelated
  Docker Desktop or Colima VM. Use `--no-ssh-agent` when a global
  `ssh_agent = true` setting should be disabled for a Podman run.

Advanced Podman users can establish a VM-local agent socket themselves and pass
it explicitly with `--mount`, `--env SSH_AUTH_SOCK=...`, and any required
security options. yolobox does not create or supervise that tunnel because doing
so widens the container trust boundary and requires lifecycle management outside
the container.

## Networking

By default, yolobox uses the runtime's normal bridged network.

- use `--network <name>` when you need container-name DNS on a compose network
- use `--no-network` when you want complete network isolation

## Environment passthrough

yolobox automatically passes a short list of common API/token environment variables when they exist on the host, plus `TERM`, `LANG`, and detected `TZ` for terminal usability.

Use `--no-env-passthrough` to disable those automatic host-derived environment variables. Explicit `--env KEY=value` entries still pass through, and `--gh-token` still forwards a GitHub token when requested.

For project-specific variables, put the same values in `.yolobox.toml`:

```toml
env = ["CODEX_HOME=/home/yolo/.codex-account"]
```

Use container paths rather than host-only paths or shell shortcuts such as `~`.

`--env` and `env = [...]` values are passed through verbatim; nothing in them is interpreted. Key-only entries such as `--env MY_API_KEY` forward that variable from the host unchanged.

To give the container a different value than the host uses under the same name, use `--env-from-host KEY=HOST_VAR` or `env_from_host = [...]`, which sets the container's `KEY` from the host's `HOST_VAR`:

```bash
yolobox run --env-from-host GH_TOKEN=YOLOBOX_READONLY_GH_TOKEN claude
```

Both sides are plain variable names, with no `$`. An alias fails closed: yolobox refuses to start if the host variable is unset, and it suppresses automatic passthrough and `--gh-token` for that key so the value it replaces cannot leak in. See [renaming host variables](/configuration#renaming-host-variables) for details.

## Independent Claude login

By default, `--claude-config` remains backwards-compatible: it syncs the host Claude login together with `~/.claude` and `~/.claude.json`. Durable config is mirrored incrementally, volatile `debug/` data is skipped, and host `~/.claude/projects` is live-mounted read/write so resume history stays current without being recopied.

Add `--no-claude-auth` to sync non-auth configuration while keeping the box's Claude login independent:

```bash
yolobox claude --claude-config --no-claude-auth
```

The box retains its own `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `oauthAccount`, and `userID` in the persistent `yolobox-home` volume. Host credentials from macOS Keychain or `~/.claude/.credentials.json` are not imported, and automatic `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` passthrough is suppressed. Run `/login` once inside the box. Explicit `--env` entries are still honored.

## Copilot config and login

`--copilot-config` syncs durable GitHub Copilot CLI config from `~/.copilot` (settings, MCP config, agents, skills, hooks, extensions, plugins) without deleting container-local files, skips host binaries, logs, caches, and databases, and live-mounts `~/.copilot/session-state` read/write. The host login is resolved from the `copilot-cli` keychain entry, a plaintext `config.json` token, or `gh auth token`, and forwarded as `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

```bash
yolobox copilot --copilot-config
yolobox copilot --copilot-config --no-copilot-auth
```

With `--no-copilot-auth`, host login keys are stripped from the synced `config.json`, no token is extracted, and `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` passthrough is suppressed. Run `/login` once inside the box. `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` passthrough still applies and takes precedence in Copilot CLI.

Authentication isolation does not isolate session history: `~/.claude/projects` remains a read/write host mount in both modes.

## RTK command compression

The `--rtk` flag enables RTK command-output compression for supported AI shortcuts. yolobox runs RTK init inside the container for Claude, Codex, Gemini, or OpenCode after any host config sync, so copied host config does not overwrite the RTK hooks. Automatic init suppresses RTK's interactive telemetry question and leaves telemetry disabled unless you opt in from inside the box with `rtk telemetry enable`.

RTK is installed in the base image at image build time using the latest available RTK release. yolobox does not auto-update RTK during container startup; pull or rebuild the yolobox image to pick up newer RTK releases.

## Docker access {#docker-access}

The `--docker` flag mounts the host Docker socket into the container and joins a shared `yolobox-net` network. That lets the agent:

- run Docker commands
- build images
- start sibling containers
- communicate with services by container name on the shared network

The network name is available inside the container as `$YOLOBOX_NETWORK`.

::: warning
`--docker` cannot be combined with `--no-network`.
:::

## Host clipboard

The `--clipboard` flag starts a short-lived host proxy and exposes text clipboard command shims inside the container: `pbcopy`, `pbpaste`, `xclip`, `xsel`, `wl-copy`, and `wl-paste`.

This makes text copy/paste operations from tools such as Codex and Claude Code reach the host clipboard.

::: warning
`--clipboard` cannot be combined with `--no-network`, and it intentionally creates a host-write channel from inside the container.
:::

## Host URL open bridge

The `--open-bridge` flag starts a short-lived host proxy and exposes `open` and `xdg-open` command shims inside the container.

The bridge only accepts `http://` and `https://` URLs and asks the host OS to open them in the default browser.

::: warning
`--open-bridge` cannot be combined with `--no-network`, and it intentionally creates a host browser action channel from inside the container.
:::

## Project file filtering

Use `--exclude` when you want the container to see an empty placeholder instead of the real project file or directory:

```bash
yolobox claude --readonly-project --exclude ".env*" --exclude "secrets/**"
```

Use `--copy-as` when you want to substitute one file for another project path inside the staged readonly project view:

```bash
yolobox claude --readonly-project --exclude ".env*" --copy-as ".env.sandbox:.env"
```

- exclude globs are relative to the project root
- `**` matches recursively
- `copy-as` destinations must stay inside the project and already exist as files
- if both flags target the same path, `copy-as` wins
- both flags currently require `--readonly-project`
- both flags are incompatible with `--no-project`

::: warning
`--exclude` and `--copy-as` are currently supported on Docker and Podman only. Apple's `container` runtime does not support them yet.
:::

## Skipping the automatic project mount

Use `--no-project` when yolobox is running somewhere its current working directory is not visible to the Docker or Podman daemon, such as some Docker-in-Docker and remote-daemon setups.

```bash
yolobox run --no-project \
  --mount /host/path/to/project:/workspace \
  --runtime-arg=--workdir=/workspace \
  bash
```

This disables the default project mount, default workdir, and `$YOLOBOX_PROJECT_PATH`. The caller is responsible for providing any mounts and workdir the command needs.

## Derived image customization

These flags map to the same model described in [Project-Level Customization](/customizing):

```bash
yolobox run --packages default-jdk,maven mvn --version
yolobox run --customize-file .yolobox.Dockerfile bash
yolobox run --packages default-jdk --rebuild-image java --version
```

Use them when you want a one-off customization without writing config first.

## Raw runtime passthrough {#advanced}

Anything not covered by a dedicated flag can still be forwarded with `--runtime-arg`:

```bash
yolobox run \
  --runtime-arg "--ulimit" \
  --runtime-arg "nofile=4096:8192" \
  --runtime-arg "--security-opt" \
  --runtime-arg "seccomp=unconfined" \
  claude
```

Docker and Podman accept these passthrough flags unchanged. Apple's `container` runtime ignores options it does not understand.
