# Configuration

## Interactive setup

Run `yolobox setup` to write global defaults to `~/.config/yolobox/config.toml`.

## Config files

### Global config

Path: `~/.config/yolobox/config.toml`

Applies to all projects:

```toml
default_harness = "codex"
# platform = "linux/amd64" # run emulated; persistent volumes are kept per architecture
git_config = true
claude_config = true
no_claude_auth = true # keep the box login independent from the host
copilot_config = true
# no_copilot_auth = true # keep the box's Copilot login independent from the host
opencode_config = true
kimi_config = true
pi_config = true
gh_token = true
rtk = true
ssh_agent = true # use --no-ssh-agent to override for one run
docker = true
clipboard = true
open_bridge = true
network = "my_compose_network"
# no_network = true # incompatible with network, pod, docker, clipboard, and open_bridge
no_env_passthrough = true
no_yolo = true
cpus = "4"
memory = "8g"
cap_add = ["SYS_PTRACE"]
devices = ["/dev/kvm:/dev/kvm"]
runtime_args = ["--security-opt", "seccomp=unconfined"]
```

### Project config

Path: `.yolobox.toml`

Place in your project root for project-specific settings:

```toml
default_harness = "none"
mounts = ["../shared-libs:/libs:ro"]
env = ["DEBUG=1"]
readonly_project = true
container_name = "project-yolobox"
exclude = [".env*", "secrets/**"]
copy_as = [".env.sandbox:.env"]
no_network = true
no_env_passthrough = true
shm_size = "2g"

[customize]
packages = ["default-jdk", "maven"]
```

Use `env = ["KEY=value"]` for per-project environment variables that should be passed directly to the process inside yolobox. Values are not shell-expanded by yolobox, so use container paths such as `/home/yolo/.codex-account` rather than `~/.codex-account` when configuring tool homes:

```toml
env = ["CODEX_HOME=/home/yolo/.codex-account"]
```

### Precedence

CLI flags > project config > global config > defaults

Use `container_name` or `--name` only when you need a stable runtime container name for inspection or integration. Fixed names cannot run concurrently; Docker, Podman, or Apple container will reject a second live container with the same name.

## Emulated architectures

Set `platform` (or pass `--platform`) to run the container under emulation, e.g. `linux/amd64` on Apple Silicon. The value is passed to the runtime's `run`, `pull`, and custom-image `build` commands. Apple `container` does not support it.

Persistent volumes are kept per architecture so native and emulated sessions never share `/home/yolo`, `/var/cache`, or `/output`: the native architecture uses the legacy names (`yolobox-home`, `yolobox-cache`, `yolobox-output`), while any other architecture gets suffixed volumes such as `yolobox-home-amd64`. `yolobox reset --force` removes all of them; add `--platform` to reset just one architecture.

yolobox resolves a single effective platform and uses it for the run, image pulls, custom-image builds, and volume selection, so the architecture that runs always matches the volumes that are mounted. In precedence order:

1. `platform` / `--platform`, or a `--platform` entry in `runtime_args`. If both are set they must agree, otherwise yolobox errors out.
2. The `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` environment variable. yolobox passes this on explicitly rather than leaving it to the runtime. It is ignored for Apple `container`, which cannot act on it and always runs natively.
3. The native host architecture.

The resolved platform and architecture are reported in the [context manifest](#context-manifest) as `runtime.platform` and `runtime.arch`.

## Default harness

Set `default_harness` to one AI shortcut name to make bare `yolobox` launch that tool:

```toml
default_harness = "codex"
```

Valid values are `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `kimi`, `agy`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `pi`, and `none`. Use `none` in project config to override a global default harness and keep bare `yolobox` as an interactive shell. `yolobox shell` always opens a shell regardless of this setting.

## Project file filtering

Use project config when you want a repo to carry its own sandboxed view:

```toml
exclude = [".env*", "secrets/**"]
copy_as = [".env.sandbox:.env"]
```

- `exclude` globs are relative to the project root and support `**`
- `copy_as` sources can be relative or absolute host paths
- `copy_as` destinations must stay inside the project and already exist as files
- `copy_as` takes precedence if it targets the same path as `exclude`
- both options currently require `readonly_project = true` or `--readonly-project`
- both options are incompatible with `no_project = true` or `--no-project`
- Apple's `container` runtime does not support this feature yet

## Skipping the automatic project mount

Set `no_project = true` only in advanced environments where yolobox's current working directory is not visible to the Docker or Podman daemon. In that mode, provide the mount and workdir explicitly:

```toml
no_project = true
mounts = ["/host/path/to/project:/workspace"]
runtime_args = ["--workdir=/workspace"]
```

`no_project = true` cannot be combined with `readonly_project`, `exclude`, or `copy_as`.

## Customization config

Project-level image customization lives under `[customize]`:

```toml
[customize]
packages = ["default-jdk", "maven"]
dockerfile = ".yolobox.Dockerfile"
```

Use `packages` for apt installs. Use `dockerfile` when you need extra build logic on top of that.

## Runtime args format

Each `runtime_args` entry is a single CLI argument. For flags that take a value, add them as separate entries:

```toml
runtime_args = ["--security-opt", "seccomp=unconfined"]
```

## Host clipboard

Set `clipboard = true` or pass `--clipboard` to bridge text clipboard copy/paste between the container and the host. yolobox starts a short-lived host proxy for the session and exposes clipboard command shims inside the container: `pbcopy`, `pbpaste`, `xclip`, `xsel`, `wl-copy`, and `wl-paste`.

`clipboard = true` cannot be combined with `no_network = true`.

## Host URL open bridge

Set `open_bridge = true` or pass `--open-bridge` to bridge URL opening from the container to the host. yolobox starts a short-lived host proxy for the session and exposes `open` and `xdg-open` shims inside the container.

The bridge only accepts `http://` and `https://` URLs and asks the host OS to open them in the default browser. `open_bridge = true` cannot be combined with `no_network = true`.

## RTK command compression

Set `rtk = true` or pass `--rtk` to enable RTK command-output compression for supported AI shortcuts. yolobox installs the latest RTK release available when the base image is built, then runs RTK init inside the container for Claude, Codex, Gemini, or OpenCode after any host config sync. Automatic init suppresses RTK's interactive telemetry question and leaves telemetry disabled unless you opt in from inside the box with `rtk telemetry enable`.

yolobox does not auto-update RTK at startup. To get a newer RTK release, rebuild or pull a newer yolobox image. Copilot and Pi are not auto-initialized because RTK does not currently provide a matching non-project config hook for them.

## Global agent instructions {#global-agent-instructions}

The `--copy-agent-instructions` flag copies your global or user-level instruction files and skills into the container.

Files copied if they exist on your host:

| Tool | Source | Destination |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Claude | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `/home/yolo/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| Claude skills | `~/.claude/skills/` | `/home/yolo/.claude/skills/` |
| Gemini/Antigravity | `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` | `/home/yolo/.gemini/GEMINI.md` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` | `/home/yolo/.codex/AGENTS.md` |
| Codex skills | `~/.codex/skills/` | `/home/yolo/.codex/skills/` |
| Kimi Code | `~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md` | `/home/yolo/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md` |
| Kimi Code skills | `~/.kimi-code/skills/` | `/home/yolo/.kimi-code/skills/` |
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` | `/home/yolo/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| Pi skills | `~/.pi/agent/skills/` | `/home/yolo/.pi/agent/skills/` |
| Copilot | `~/.copilot/agents/` | `/home/yolo/.copilot/agents/` |

This copies instruction files and skills, not full configs, credentials, settings, or history. For full tool configs, use `--claude-config`, `--codex-config`, `--copilot-config`, `--gemini-config`, `--kimi-config`, `--opencode-config`, or `--pi-config`. Antigravity CLI stores its config under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli`, so `--gemini-config` covers Antigravity too.

## Independent Claude login

`claude_config = true` incrementally syncs durable host Claude configuration on every start. It skips volatile `debug/` data and live-mounts host `~/.claude/projects` read/write so Claude session history can be resumed from either side without recopying the transcript tree. Its backwards-compatible default also syncs the host OAuth login, including credentials extracted from macOS Keychain.

Set `no_claude_auth = true` or pass `--no-claude-auth` to share non-auth configuration without cloning that login into the box:

```toml
claude_config = true
no_claude_auth = true
```

In this mode, yolobox:

- skips macOS Keychain credential extraction
- excludes host `.credentials.json` and OAuth refresh-lock state while syncing `~/.claude`
- preserves the box's `oauthAccount` and `userID` when updating `~/.claude.json`
- suppresses automatic host `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` passthrough

Run `/login` once inside the box. Its login persists in the architecture-specific `yolobox-home` volume and is reused across later starts. Explicit `env` or `--env` values remain explicit overrides. `no_claude_auth` requires `claude_config`. It isolates authentication, not history: the host `projects/` directory remains live-mounted read/write.

## Copilot config and login

`copilot_config = true` (or `--copilot-config`) incrementally syncs durable host GitHub Copilot CLI configuration from `~/.copilot` (or `$COPILOT_HOME`) on every start: `settings.json`, `mcp-config.json`, agents, skills, hooks, extensions, installed plugins, and the non-auth parts of `config.json`. It never removes container-local files. Host-platform binaries (`pkg/`), logs, caches, app state, and SQLite databases are skipped, and host `session-state/` is live-mounted read/write so `copilot --resume` sees the same sessions on both sides. While the mount is active, any existing container session state is kept aside as `session-state.container` and restored when the flag is off.

By default the host Copilot login is forwarded as `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`. yolobox resolves it the way Copilot CLI does: the OS keychain entry (`copilot-cli`), a plaintext token in `config.json` (which then syncs with the config), or `gh auth token`. Classic `ghp_` tokens are ignored because Copilot CLI rejects them. An explicit `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` from passthrough, `env`, or `--env` wins.

Set `no_copilot_auth = true` or pass `--no-copilot-auth` to share settings without the host login:

```toml
copilot_config = true
no_copilot_auth = true
```

In this mode, yolobox skips keychain and `gh` token extraction, strips login and token keys from the synced `config.json` while keeping the box's own, and suppresses automatic `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` passthrough. Run `/login` once inside the box; it persists in the `yolobox-home` volume. `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` passthrough and `--gh-token` are unchanged, and Copilot CLI uses them before its stored login, so add `--no-env-passthrough` if those must not authenticate Copilot. `no_copilot_auth` requires `copilot_config`, and session history stays live-mounted.

## Explicit environment variables

Pass extra environment variables with `env = [...]` in config or `--env KEY=value` on the CLI.

```toml
env = [
  "DEBUG=1",       # literal value, passed through verbatim
  "MY_API_KEY",    # key only: forwards MY_API_KEY from the host as-is
]
```

Values are passed to the container runtime verbatim. Nothing in them is interpreted, so a value containing `$` (a bcrypt hash, a shell fragment, a jq filter) arrives unchanged. Key-only entries (no `=`) are passed to the runtime unchanged too, which forwards the variable from the host under the same name.

## Renaming host variables

`env_from_host = [...]` in config and `--env-from-host KEY=HOST_VAR` on the CLI set the container variable `KEY` from the host variable `HOST_VAR`. Use this to give the sandbox a different value than the host uses under the same name:

```toml
env_from_host = [
  "GH_TOKEN=YOLOBOX_READONLY_GH_TOKEN",  # container GH_TOKEN = host YOLOBOX_READONLY_GH_TOKEN
]
```

With that config, a host shell holding a read-write `GH_TOKEN` and a read-only `YOLOBOX_READONLY_GH_TOKEN` gives the container only the read-only one, without the token ever being written into `.yolobox.toml`.

Both sides are plain variable names — write `GH_TOKEN=YOLOBOX_READONLY_GH_TOKEN`, not `GH_TOKEN=$YOLOBOX_READONLY_GH_TOKEN`.

An alias owns its container variable, and it fails closed:

- If the host variable is not set, yolobox refuses to start the container. Skipping the entry would let the more privileged variable it replaces reach the container instead.
- The alias suppresses every other source for that key. [Automatic passthrough](#auto-forwarded-environment-variables) and `--gh-token` are skipped for an aliased key, so `GH_TOKEN=YOLOBOX_READONLY_GH_TOKEN` cannot be shadowed by the host's read-write `GH_TOKEN`.
- Setting the same key in both `env` and `env_from_host` is an error. Pick one.

## Auto-forwarded environment variables

These are automatically passed into the container if they are set on the host:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`
- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `KIMI_API_KEY`
- `MINIMAX_API_KEY`
- `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
- `XAI_API_KEY`
- `ZAI_API_KEY`
- `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

Set `no_env_passthrough = true` or pass `--no-env-passthrough` to disable all automatic host environment passthrough. This suppresses the API/token list above plus `TERM`, `LANG`, and detected `TZ`; explicit `env = [...]` config and `--env KEY=value` still pass through, and `gh_token = true` or `--gh-token` still forwards a GitHub token when requested.

::: tip macOS and GitHub tokens
On macOS, `gh` stores tokens in Keychain, not environment variables. Use `--gh-token` or `gh_token = true` if you want yolobox to extract and forward the GitHub token. When a token is present, yolobox also configures HTTPS Git auth for `github.com` remotes.

## Runtime context manifest {#context-manifest}

Every yolobox session provides a runtime manifest at `/run/yolobox/context.json` and sets `YOLOBOX_CONTEXT_FILE` to that path.

The manifest is intended for agents and scripts running inside the container. It exposes the resolved runtime and launch context in JSON, including an `inside_yolobox` confirmation, the effective config, container paths, the resolved container platform and architecture, launch command, fork metadata when `yolobox fork` is active, and the keys of forwarded environment variables without copying their values into the manifest.

The canonical skill packages live under [`skills/`](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox/tree/master/skills):

- [`skills/yolobox`](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox/tree/master/skills/yolobox) is the inside-the-box skill that orients the agent to the trusted yolobox sandbox it is running in, then uses this manifest to explain the current sandbox accurately. Its `Readonly project mode` line reports the launch mode; its `Project writable now` line is a live filesystem check. yolobox currently installs it for Claude, Codex, and Kimi Code sessions inside the container.
- [`skills/yolobox-orchestrator`](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox/tree/master/skills/yolobox-orchestrator) is the host-side skill for agents that need to launch or control yolobox itself.

yolobox also injects a managed guidance block into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, and `~/.kimi-code/AGENTS.md` so those agents know to use the `yolobox` skill when current sandbox assumptions matter.

## Config sync warning

::: warning
Setting `claude_config = true`, `codex_config = true`, `copilot_config = true`, `gemini_config = true`, `kimi_config = true`, `opencode_config = true`, or `pi_config = true` in config syncs your host config on every container start. Claude config sync incrementally mirrors durable files, skips volatile `debug/`, preserves a valid in-container credential when the host has no usable credential, and live-mounts host `projects/` read/write; with `no_claude_auth = true`, it also preserves the container account identity and excludes host credentials. Gemini/Antigravity, OpenCode, and Pi config sync replaces the matching in-container config directory, overwriting changes made inside the container. Antigravity CLI stores its settings under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli`, so `gemini_config = true` covers it. Kimi Code config sync incrementally merges host config, credentials, skills, and sessions into `~/.kimi-code` while leaving the container's `bin/`, `logs/`, and `updates/` paths alone. Codex config sync incrementally merges durable host files into `~/.codex`, skips volatile Codex log, state, cache, and temp files, preserves a valid in-container `auth.json` when the host copy has no usable auth file, and live-mounts host Codex sessions so resume history stays current without copying it. Prefer the config flags for ongoing syncs. A one-time run imports durable config, but live Claude project history and Codex sessions require the matching flag on each run. Copilot config sync incrementally merges durable host files into `~/.copilot`, skips host binaries, logs, caches, and databases, merges `config.json` while keeping container login keys the host lacks, and live-mounts host `session-state/`.

## Startup timing diagnostics

Set `YOLOBOX_TIMING=1` to print host-side and container-entrypoint timing markers:

```bash
YOLOBOX_TIMING=1 yolobox run true
```

This is useful when diagnosing slow config sync, Docker startup, update checks, or runtime argument construction.

yolobox removes a zero-byte `/home/yolo/.codex/auth.json` during startup. Recent Codex versions fail with `EOF while parsing a value` when that stale file exists; removing it lets Codex recreate auth normally or show the sign-in flow.

If Codex auth fails with `No space left on device`, the Docker or Podman storage backing `/home/yolo` or `/tmp` is full. Check `docker system df` or the equivalent for your runtime, then reclaim runtime storage or increase the VM disk size. yolobox warns at container startup when those paths are nearly full, but it does not automatically prune unrelated images, volumes, or build cache.
