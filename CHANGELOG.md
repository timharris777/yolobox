# Changelog

All notable changes to yolobox are documented here.

This changelog was backfilled from Git tags, annotated tag messages, and commit
history. Versions are listed newest first. There is no `v0.6.0` entry because
there is no `v0.6.0` tag in this repository.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `--copilot-config` / `copilot_config = true` to incrementally sync host GitHub Copilot CLI config, forward the host Copilot login as `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, and live-mount `~/.copilot/session-state` for resume continuity, plus `--no-copilot-auth` / `no_copilot_auth = true` to keep the box's Copilot login independent.
- Added `yolobox completion bash|zsh` to print shell completion scripts for subcommands, AI shortcuts, flags, and common flag values. The Homebrew formula now installs bash and zsh completions automatically.

## v0.19.4 - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Made `--ssh-agent` runtime-aware on macOS: Podman machine now fails with actionable guidance instead of mounting a Docker Desktop or Colima VM socket, forwarding setup failures no longer silently launch without the requested agent, and `--no-ssh-agent` can override a configured default for Podman runs.

## v0.19.3 - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Let Claude Code's native installer own its persistent launcher so `claude update` and `yolobox update-agents claude` activate the installed version and can clean up superseded downloads. Existing image-owned launchers are migrated without replacing other user-managed launchers.

## v0.19.2 - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Made `--claude-config` startup incremental instead of deleting, recopying, and recursively rechowning the full host config tree. Claude project history is now live-mounted for resume continuity, volatile debug data is skipped, valid container credentials survive when the host has none, and `--no-claude-auth` isolation remains intact.

## v0.19.1 - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Prevented first-time RTK setup from hanging agent startup on a hidden telemetry consent prompt; telemetry remains disabled unless the user opts in interactively inside the box.

## v0.19.0 - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Added `--platform` flag and `platform` config key to run the container under emulation (e.g. `linux/amd64` on Apple Silicon), passed through to runtime `run`, `pull`, and custom-image `build`.
- Persistent volumes are now kept per architecture: the native architecture keeps the legacy `yolobox-home`/`yolobox-cache`/`yolobox-output` names, while emulated architectures get suffixed volumes (e.g. `yolobox-home-amd64`), so native and emulated sessions no longer share `/home/yolo`. The architecture comes from a single effective platform — `--platform`/`platform`, a `--platform` entry in `runtime_args`, or `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` (ignored for Apple `container`, which cannot act on it) — so the architecture that runs always matches the volumes that are mounted.
- Added `--platform` to `yolobox reset` to wipe a single architecture's volumes; without it, reset now discovers and removes yolobox volumes for all architectures (including `yolobox-output`, which was previously missed).
- The context manifest now reports the effective platform and container architecture, so in-box guidance sees the same resolved launch context as the runtime.
- Added `env_from_host = [...]` config entries and `--env-from-host KEY=HOST_VAR` to set a container environment variable from a differently named host variable, for example mapping a read-only host token into `GH_TOKEN` inside the container. `env` and `--env` values remain verbatim. An alias owns its container variable: automatic passthrough and `--gh-token` are suppressed for that key, setting the same key in both `env` and `env_from_host` is rejected, and an unset host source aborts the run instead of falling back to the variable the alias replaces.
- Added `--no-claude-auth` / `no_claude_auth = true` for `--claude-config`, allowing host Claude settings to sync while the persistent box keeps an independent `/login` session.

### Fixed

- Stopped host Claude OAuth credentials, account identity, and automatic `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` passthrough from overwriting container-local authentication when `--no-claude-auth` is enabled.

## v0.18.5 - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added `--ensure-latest` to force-pull the configured base image before running and rebuild any derived custom image when the base changed.
- Added first-class Kimi Code support with a bundled CLI, the `yolobox kimi` shortcut, setup and default-harness integration, optional `~/.kimi-code` sync, persistent updates through `yolobox update-agents kimi`, and built-in yolobox guidance.

### Changed

- Clarified project-level `env` configuration across the README, docs site, and bundled orchestrator guidance.

## v0.18.4 - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Added `yolobox update-agents` to update Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, OpenCode, Copilot, and Pi inside the persistent yolobox home volume, with optional per-tool targets.

## v0.18.3 - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added Antigravity CLI support with `yolobox agy` and `yolobox antigravity` shortcuts.
- Added YOLO-mode Antigravity wrappers that run `agy --dangerously-skip-permissions`.

### Changed

- Documented that `--gemini-config` also covers Antigravity config under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli`.

## v0.18.2 - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Stopped resetting the Claude Code launcher to the image binary on every startup, so Claude self-upgrades in the persistent home volume survive later yolobox runs.
- Refreshed the Claude Code installer layer on each release image build so new yolobox images seed from the current upstream installer instead of a stale cached layer.

## v0.18.1 - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Scoped npm package release-age gating to yolobox's own base-image build installs; runtime npm/npx commands and CLI self-updates are unrestricted by default.

### Added

- Added `--name` / `container_name` support for assigning a runtime container name.

## v0.18.0 - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added opt-in RTK command-output compression for supported AI CLIs with `--rtk` or `rtk = true`.
- Added concise release summaries to update prompts and post-upgrade output.
- Added `yolobox upgrade --check` to inspect the latest release without changing the binary or image.

### Changed

- GitHub releases now use the curated `CHANGELOG.md` section for the release body so CLI update prompts can show human-written notes.
- Documented that releases must be tagged only from a clean, up-to-date `master` branch and pushed with the specific release tag.

## v0.17.1 - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Added this changelog.
- Added `YOLOBOX_TIMING=1` startup diagnostics for host-side and container entrypoint timing.

### Fixed

- Made Codex config sync incremental, installed `rsync` in the base image, skipped volatile log/state/cache/temp files, and live-mounted host Codex sessions so large host `~/.codex` trees are not recopied and rechowned on every yolobox start.

## v0.17.0 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added Pi agent support to the base image and CLI shortcuts.
